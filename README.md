Welcome to my **DSA Daily Journal**!  
This repository is a personal log of my journey learning **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
I’ll be updating it regularly with notes, algorithms, and problem solutions to track my progress and stay consistent.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `notes/` → Daily learning logs (Day-wise breakdown of concepts, problems solved, and reflections)  
- `algorithms/` → Summaries & explanations of algorithms with code examples  
- `problems/` → Problem-solving notes categorized by difficulty (easy, medium, hard)  
- `resources/` → References, tutorials, and useful links  
- `progress.md` → Timeline & progress tracker

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in **DSA**  
- Stay consistent with **daily learning**  
- Solve problems and track progress  
- Share notes & insights for future reference (and maybe help others too!)
